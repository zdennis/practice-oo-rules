## Goal

The goal of this repository is to help developers think about and have discussion around the different ways that organizing solutions for a simple set of rules. 

## How It Works

Each branch in this repository represents a different technique to implementing a simple set of rules. Since each branch is a different technique it's easy to compare and contrast different approaches. Each branch will include its own README which summarizes the techniques and the pros/cons. 

## Simple and Quick

Learning shouldn't always take a giant example or application that require you to spend hours, days, or a week to work through. So here, there are few rules and those that exist are very simple. 

Simple rules can be representative of more complex ones. By keeping the rules here very simple it lets the implementation approach to be readily visible. That means it's up to you to extrapolate how these different approaches may apply in situations you encounter in every day programs. But the benefit of this is that you can spend a handful of minutes looking at the different approaches in this repository, perhaps even contribute your own, and leave feeling you have learned something or at least confirmed something.

## Contributing

There is a single spec which is failing currently. Construct your branch off from master and make it pass with whatever approach you want. Update the README in your branch to describe whatever you want about the approach (i.e. maybe pros/cons, comparisons to other approaches, etc)

  git checkout -b <my_well_named_branch> master
  
When you're ready to contribute just submit a pull request.
